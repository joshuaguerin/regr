# regr - Regular Expression Tester

Command-line regular expression tester. Designed originally for my Theory of Computation class.

While I'm sure other options exist, at the point I wrote this I looked around the Internet and wasn't satisfied with the options I found so I wrote a couple of quick scripts to do the job.

Input/output format are designed to correspond closely to those used by [JFLAP](https://www.jflap.org/), since I currently use JFLAP for other forms of automata for assignments. I didn't like how JFLAP handled regular expressions, so coming up with an auxiliary tool made sense.

## Use

The two tools are regr and bregr. The former handles a single regular expression and the second allows easy batch processing of one or more regular expressions (e.g., multiple submissions of a problem in an assignment).
